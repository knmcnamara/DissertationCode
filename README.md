## K. McNamara Dissertation: The Effect of Organizational Characteristics Upon Women's Labor and Birth Experiences in the United States
This repository consists of the SPSS syntax used to conduct the quantitative data analysis for this dissertation. For this project I conducted descriptive statistics, correlations, crosstabulation, and binary logistic regression analysis. In addition, I ran interaction effects, but these analysis did not produce significant findings.
## Data Set: Childbirth Connection's Listening to Mothers III
This data set came from Childbirth Connection. This online survey sampled 2,400 women aged 18-45. This nationally representative study asked women that had given birth between July 1, 2011 and June 30, 2012 in U.S. hospitals about their birth experiences. Survey participants took the survey between October and December 2012. Upon completion they were asked to complete a follow- up survey between January 29, 2013 and April 15, 2013 after they had given birth. The post-partum Listening to Mothers III survey was different from previous versions because it asked women questions about the hospital they gave birth in, including the hospital name, city and state. My sample was reduced to 903 women, as hospital information was available for those respondents. Hospital ownership status was identified based upon the fiscal year the respondent gave birth with data from the American Hospital Associationâ€™s (AHA) Hospital Database (Morris et. al. 2017). The hospital financial health measures, catholic affiliation, system membership, and size were also provided by the AHA Hospital database.

## Project Details:
For my analysis, I had access to some data that is not publicly available. However, there is still extensive information and data available to download online. In addition, it may be worth mentioning that the data is in SPSS format. Obviously this data can be utilized with other software programs, but I thought it was worth mentioning. Finally, the data sets that I will be referencing in my syntax have been cleaned for analysis purposes and include the non-public data. This is why the data is not included here.

Since all of my data analysis is not publicly available, this project cannot be duplicated exactly or contributed to. However, hopefully this syntax can be helpful to others conducting quantitative data analysis.
